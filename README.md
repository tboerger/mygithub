As I'm iterating quite often across all repositories for specific GitHub
organizations I have created this small utility that currently just prints
out all available repositories for specific users or organizations. Maybe I
will add more features if I need it, this tool is more for personal use
cases.


## Install

Make sure you have a working Go environment, for further reference or a guide
take a look at the [install instructions](http://golang.org/doc/install.html)
