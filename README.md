# mygithub

As I'm iterating quite often across all repositories for specific GitHub
organizations I have created this small utility that currently just prints
out all available repositories for specific users or organizations.

Maybe I will add more features if I need it, this tool is more for personal
use cases.


## Usage

```bash
mygithub --token mysecrettoken list tboerger
```
